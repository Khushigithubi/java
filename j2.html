    <h2>Java Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.</p>
    <h4>Single-line Comments</h4>
    <p>Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).<br>Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).
    </p><br>
    <p>Example<br>// This is a comment<br>
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    </p>
    <h4>Java Multi-line Comments</h4>
    <p>Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.<br>
       Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.
    </p>
    <h2>Java Variables</h2>   
    <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.<br>
    In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:<br></p>
    <ul><li>String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
        <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
        <li> float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
        <li> char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
        <li> boolean - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:<br>
        int myNum = 5;<br>
        float myFloatNum = 5.99f;<br>
        char myLetter = 'D';<br>
        boolean myBool = true;<br>
        String myText = "Hello";<br>
    </p> 
    <h3>Identifiers</h3>  
    <p>All Java variables must be identified with unique names.<br>
       These unique names are called identifiers.<br>
       Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
    </p>
    <p>The general rules for naming variables are:</p> 
    <ul><li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs</li>
        <li>Names must begin with a letter</li>
        <li>Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace</li>
        <li>Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)</li>
        <li>Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)</li>
        <li>Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Java Data Types</h2>
    <p>Data types are divided into two groups:</p>
    <ul><li>Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char</li>
        <li>Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes </li>
    </ul>

        <h2> Primitive Numbers</h2>
        <p>Primitive number types are divided into two groups:<br>
           <b>Integer types</b> stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are byte, short, int and long. Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value.<br>
           <b>Floating point types</b> represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: float and double.
        </p>
        <h3>Integer Types</h3>
        <h4>Byte</h4>
        <p>The byte data type can store whole numbers from -128 to 127. This can be used instead of int or other integer types to save <br>
            memory when you are certain that the value will be within -128 and 127
        </p>
        <p>Example:<br>
            byte myNum = 100;
        </p>
        <h4>Short</h4>
        <p>The short data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767</p>
        <p>Example:<br>
            short myNum = 5000;
        </p>
        <h4>Int</h4>
        <p>The int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647. In general, and in our tutorial, the int data type is <br>the preferred data type when we create variables with a numeric value.</p>
        <p>Example:<br>
            int myNum = 100000;</p>
         <h4>Long</h4>
         <p>The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. This is used when int is not <br>large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L"</p>
         <p>Example:<br>
            long myNum = 15000000000L;</p>
         <h3>Floating Point Types</h3>   
         <p>You should use a floating point type whenever you need a number with a decimal, such as 9.99 or 3.14515.<br>
            The float and double data types can store fractional numbers. Note that you should end the value with an "f" for floats and "d" for doubles.
        </p>
        <p>Float Example<br>
            float myNum = 5.75f;</p>
         <p>Double Example<br>
            double myNum = 19.99d;</p>  
         <h4>Scientific Numbers</h4>    
         <p>A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10</p>
         <p>Example:<br>float f1 = 35e3f;<br>
            double d1 = 12E4d;</p>
         <h2>Boolean Types</h2>   
         <p>Very often in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:<br>
            YES / NO<br>
            ON / OFF<br>
            TRUE / FALSE<br>
            For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can only take the values true or false</p>
            <p>Example:<br>
                boolean isJavaFun = true;<br>
                boolean isFishTasty = false;
            </p>
        <h2>Characters</h2>    
        <p>The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c'</p>
        <p>Example:<br>char myGrade = 'B'</p>
        <h2>Strings</h2>
        <p>The String data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes</p>
        <p>Example:<br>String greeting = "Hello World"</p>
        <h2>Non-Primitive Data Types</h2>
        <p>Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.<br><br>
          The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:<br><br>
             Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).<br>
            Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.<br>
            A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.<br>
            A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.<br>
            The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.<br>
            Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc.</p>
